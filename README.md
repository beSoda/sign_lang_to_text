This repository contains the source code and resources for a Sign Language Recognition System. The aim of this project is to develop a computer vision system that can recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real-time, specifically American Sign Language (ASL). This is a **beginner friendly** guide.

# Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Installation and Setup
We will be using `Visual Studio Code` as our main platform to run this model.
 1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to your local device.

 2. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run the installer. **MAKE SURE** you check the box that says `Add Python to PATH` before clicking `Install Now`.

    _**Note:** Python version 3.11 is most ideal_

 4. Launch `Visual Studio Code`, click on `Extensions` on the left panel, search for `Python` and install the extension.

 5. On the bottom right, click on `Select Intepreter` and select the `Python` version that you've installed earlier.

 Hence, your `VS Code` setup is ready.

 # Code Setup
 Now that your `VS Code` is ready to be used, it's time to setup our code. We will need to create a virtual environment and install a few packages beforehand.

  1. Download the ZIP FILE

  2. Extract "sign_lang_to_text" to download.
  
  3. Extract "sign_lang_to_text" from zip file to download.

  4. Open the Extracted folder.

  5. Open the terminal`(Ctrl + ~)` and run:
     ```
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
     This will create a folder named `myenv` with your virtual environment. `myenv` can be replaced with any other name you wish.

  6. Activate the environment by running:
     ```
     \myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
     After this, your terminal should show `(myenv)` in green - this means you are in the virtual environment.

  7. Install the required libraries:
     ```
     pip install torch numpy opencv-python mediapipe
     ```
     ***Note:** You may go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to install the correct version of PyTorch for your system if you are using a GPU (e.g. NVIDIA) and want to speed up the model training.*
     
# Running the Model
  Now that our code setup is done, we can finally run the model.

  1. Run `live_recognition.py` and allow `Python` to access your device's camera. A seperate window will appear.
  2. Show a gesture towards the camera. The model will translate the gesture showing `gesture:`.

     _The gesture above translates into `Hello`._

  3. Press `Q` to exit the window and end the model.
